# Fibonacci

This Python script generates the **Fibonacci series** up to a user-defined number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a well-known series in mathematics where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

## 🔢 What is the Fibonacci Series?

The sequence starts with `0` and `1`, and then each next term is the sum of the previous two:

## 💡 What It Does

- Asks the user how many terms of the Fibonacci series they want.
- Uses a `for` loop to generate that many terms.
- Prints each term on a new line.

## 📁 File

- `fibonacci.py`: Contains the logic to generate the Fibonacci series.

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python fibonacci.py
